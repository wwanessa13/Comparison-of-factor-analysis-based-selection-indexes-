# Comparison-of-factor-analysis-based-selection-indexes-
This repository contains the simulated datasets used in the paper “Impact of trait and environment correlations, and heritability on the efficiency of factor analysis-based selection indexes”. 

The datasets were generated to evaluate the performance of different selection indexes under varying scenarios of trait correlation, environmental correlation, and heritability. They are provided to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and to support further methodological research in plant breeding and quantitative genetics.
